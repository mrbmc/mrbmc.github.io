# Colophon

## Site Info
This is a static website because reasons:
* **Performance** Static websites load faster than web apps.
* **Durability** I don't have to maintain frameworks and libraries to make it work because it's based on standard web technology.
* **Flexibility** The simplicity of the build makes it very easy to make changes
* **Portability:** Just grab the files and go. 
* **Cost:** hosting a static site is only 12¢ a month.

## Key Apps

* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is my preferred site generator.
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my code editor.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my markdown editor for blog entries and portfolio case studies.
* [Awesome Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alelhddbbhepgpmgidjdcjakblofbmce) is my favorite tool for grabbing screensots and recordings.
* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/) & [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/) for hosting. I don't love Amazon but I do love paying 10¢ / month.

## Production Support

 <a href="https://www.drinktrade.com">Trade Coffee</a> supplies our Caffeine. I prefer light roast single origin beans brewed using an [AeroPress](https://aeropress.com/).

Transportation provided by custom-built bikes:  
**tarmac:** [2020 Dengfu R01](https://www.dengfubike.com/collections/carbon-bike-frame/products/r01-frame) + 105 + Winspace Lún + Conti tc5000  
**gravel:** [2017 Crust Romanceür](https://crustbikes.com/products/a-romantic-tale-the-romanceur) + GRX + Velocity Aileron + Gravel Kings

## Style Guide

### Typography

The primary typeface is Helvetica Neue.

For extended prose we use a native serif: Hoefler on MacOS & iOS, Palatino on Android and Windows.

{% assign typefactor = 1.3 %}

# H1 Titular Heading ({{ typefactor | times: typefactor | times: typefactor | times: typefactor | round: 4 }}rem)

## H2 Section Heading Title ({{ typefactor | times: typefactor | times: typefactor | round: 4 }}rem)

### H3 Sub-Section Heading Title ({{ typefactor | times: typefactor | round: 4 }}rem)

#### H4 Component Heading Title ({{ 1 | times: 1 | round: 4 }}rem)

##### H5 Component Sub-Heading Title ({{ 1 | times: typefactor | round: 4 }}rem)

Body:  (1rem)  
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.

Body.Large:  ({{ 1 | times: typefactor | round: 4 }}rem)  
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.{.largeType}

Body.Small:  ({{ 1 | divided_by: typefactor | round: 4 }}rem)  
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.{.smallType}

Prose:  
Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. {.serif}
